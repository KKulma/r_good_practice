```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I've been asked more and more about 


### use R projects. Always.
1) all code and outputs stored in one location
2) use of relative file locations - better reproducibility 


### first thing: load necessary packages but also consider calling functions in a package via `::`

### describe he purpose of he code / project

### Name your code chunks and use them for navigation. 

### Make your life easier by using a red dot when you need to. 

### Write your code as if someone was going to use it without communicating with you. From day one
- commenting
- as clear and efficient as possible
- ideally timed and tested 


### name your files like a Pro.
- [Jenny Bryan's slides](https://t.co/99waX8liuQ)

### if you have to copy/paste bit of code at least 3 times, write a function. 


### With big, complex data projects, use project pipeline.

### Never save the working directory


### Before publshing/sharing your code, run it in the fresh workspace.
